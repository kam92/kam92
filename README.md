### Thanks for visiting!


<div>
  <p> I'm currently focusing on my back-end skills (mainly Java, but also Nodejs and PHP). I'm very resourceful with my tools and shell scripts, a lot of non-work time is dedicated to explore GitHub and keep on sharpening my toolset. I'd rather keep it simple, use vim whenever possible and avoid fancy IDEs (except for Java).</p>
  <p> I also have vast experience with computer troubleshooting and setting up working environments, I can deal with any problem in any OS or hardware. </p>

    <p> I work mostly on private repos, you will not find all my contributions publicly. </p>

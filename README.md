  <p> I'm currently focusing on my back-end skills (mainly Java, but also Nodejs and PHP). I'm very resourceful with my tools, plugins, and shell scripts, most of my non-work time is dedicated to explore GitHub and keep on sharpening my tools. I love shell, I will use vim whenever I'm allowed to.</p>
  <p> I also have vast experience with computer troubleshooting and setting up working environments, I can deal with any problem in any OS or hardware. </p>

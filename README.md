### Thanks for visiting!


<div>
  <p> I'm a software developer, currently focusing on my back-end skills (with nodejs, Java and PHP). I'm very resourceful with my tools, plugins, IDEs, shell scripts and I know a lot of interesting repos, most of my non-work time is dedicated to explore GitHub and keep on sharpening my tools. I love using the terminal and "living" inside it, I will use vim whenever I'm allowed to.</p>
  <p> I also have vast experience with computer troubleshooting and setting up working environments, I can deal with any problem in any OS or hardware, and if I don't know the fix, I know somebody that does know! </p>
